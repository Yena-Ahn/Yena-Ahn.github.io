## Welcome
Starting from *2021*, this blog will be a storage of every content I learn about *python* and *data*. The ultimate goal is to handle data sets and build the skills up that can be used effectively in workforce. 

These two books will be used to begin with; *Python: Machine Learning Pandas Data Analytics* and *Python Machine Learning Perfect Guide*. Both books are great, giving specific information and plenty of examples and codes to try. I hope these books help my learning.

I'm trying *Kaggle* as well - as a beginner, this will be my self-learning project of machine learning. PLEASE do not mind my lame progress :)
